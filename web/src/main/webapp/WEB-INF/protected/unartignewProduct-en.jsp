        <h3>You can now order your pictures as digital files!</h3>

        <p>Customers often asked for a donwload service to purchase pictures from our website. In response we extended
            our product list by two new digital products.<br/>
            You can now not only purchase prints but also the digital files of your pictures.
            After placing an order for a digital product you receive an E-Mail containing a link for downloading the
            file. The link will be active for 7 days within which you have access to the ordered files.</p>
            <br/>
            =========================== new products ===========================

        <h3>Digi Foto 600x400</h3>

        <p>Each print you order comes with a small digital image (600x400 px / ~40kB). The file quality and size is
            appropriate for E-Mail use or as a screensaver but it is inappropriate
            to serve as a source for reproducing prints. After placing an order for a print product you receive
            an E-Mail containing a link for downloading the file.<br/>
            In some albums you can order the "Digi Foto 600x400" as a separate product.</p>

        <h3>Digital Negative, Genuine</h3>

        <p>The "Digital Negative" represents the genuine data as it was captured by the camera. The image comprises 5-6 million
            pixels and the file size varies between 1.5-3 MB.<br/>
            In contrast to the "Digi Foto 600x400" we offer this product for all albums.</p>
        <br/>
        ============================ Information ============================
        <h3>Advantage</h3>

        <p>If you need a large number of prints from the same picture you are better off ordering the "Digital Negative"
            and reproducing it low-priced at a fotolab of your choice.<br/>
            In addition, if you exclusively order digital products you can safe shipping costs.</p>

        <h3>Prices</h3>

        <p>Please note that the prices may vary between albums.</p>
