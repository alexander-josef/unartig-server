<h3>Digi Foto 600x400</h3>\
<p>Each print you order comes with a small digital image (600x400 px / ~40kB). The file quality and size is\
appropriate for E-Mail use or as a screensaver but it is inappropriate\
to serve as a source for reproducing prints. After placing an order for a print product you receive\
an E-Mail containing a link for downloading the file.\
<br/>In some albums you can order the "Digi Foto 600x400" as a separate product.</p>\
<h3>Digital Negative, Genuine</h3>\
<p>The "Digital Negative" represents the genuine data as it was captured by the camera. The image comprises 5-6 million\
pixels and the file size varies between 1.5-3 MB.<br/>\
In contrast to the "Digi Foto 600x400" we offer this product for all albums.</p>\
