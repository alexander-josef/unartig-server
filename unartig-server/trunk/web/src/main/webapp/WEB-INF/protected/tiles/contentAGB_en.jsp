            These general terms and conditions apply to any individual, entities or associations having legal capacity
            that have a business connection with the unartig AG. These

        <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Publishing of photographs</span><br/>
            Photographs established by unartig AG are published at www.unartig.ch. The organizer of an event (constitutent)
            can ask for limited access to the photographs restricted to the visitors and participants of the event.
            unartig AG thereto hands out a password for such events. On demand of a client that is displayed on a photograph
            (restricted to
            photographs made in a studio) unartig AG will remove pictures before but also after uploading the photographs on
            www.unartig.ch. The unartig AG preserves the right not to publish certain photographs and the unartig AG can
            therefore nor guarantee that all generated photographs will be published.
        </p>
        <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Contracts</span><br/>Any offers made by unartig AG are subject to confirmation and
            without engagement unless the parties have agreed otherwise in writing. For services provided at an event by
            the unartig AG, a detailed contract engaging the unartig AG and the constitutent (event organizer) will be worked
            out. Therein the basic conditions for the collaboration are determined. In case the constitutent cancels the
            contract or in case the event does not take place, the unartig AG can claim damages for accured expenses. The
            details are determined in the individual contract.
        </p>
        <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Liability</span><br/>The unartig AG is keen to create high quality photographs and to
            publish them on www.unartig.ch shortly after the event (defined in the contract). The unartig AG can not be held
            liable for not or late publishing of any content at www.unartig.ch.
