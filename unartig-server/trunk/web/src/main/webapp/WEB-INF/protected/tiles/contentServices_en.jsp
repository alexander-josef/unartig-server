    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Since 1998 </span>Studio Unartig works in the field of event-photography with an
        emphasis on professional portraits. Since the beginning of 2006 Studio unArtig offers professional photo
        services for sports events.</p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Our infrastructure and software </span>allow us to offer you a professional and
        all-embracing foto service at your event.
        We make high demands on the quality and the fast availability of the photographs on our website. A user-friendly
        website and an obliging customer service
        are important to us.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>At festive events </span> we set up a professional digital photo studio. Experienced
        portrait photographers
        and high-quality equipment guarantee for photographs that leave nothing to be desired. If desired by the event
        organizer we make a reportage of
        the event, which is at the event organizers disposal. You might think such a service must be very expensive. ...
        often,
        our service is at no charge for the event organizer.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>For sports events </span> we have access to a network of talented and passionate sports
        photographers. Our service covers
        the entire organization of an all-embracing photo service, the accomplishment on site, an efficient
        post-processing and fast presentation of the
        photographs on our website.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>After an event </span>the photographs are finished and uploaded on our server where
        they are accessible to our customers. If desired by the event organizer the access to the online album can be
        limited to guests or participants of that event by a password. The server is hosted by a fail-safe data center
        providing
        sufficient bandwidth even for a high number of users in the case of a big event.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Once uploaded, </span>the photographs are available to the customers for viewing and
        ordering. Elaborate mechanisms work in the background of the user-friendly website to facilitate the search for
        photographs.
        An order is automatically forwarded to our service partner (<a href="http://www.colorplaza.ch" target="_blank">Colorplaza
        Ltd.</a>)
        that prints and ships the photographs. Customers will receive the ordered photographs within 2-3 business days.
        At the moment,
        the only available method of payment is by invoice; payment by credit card will be available soon.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Your benefit as an event organizer: </span>Besides the additional value brought to your
        event
        by our service, at big events, you can participate in our success through a profit sharing model.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Make your guests a gift: </span>You plan an anniversary, a yule or you have another
        reason for celebrating with your employees,
        friends or relatives? Make your guests a very personal and noble present of their studio visit and their
        photographs.
    </p>

    <p class="pad15Right pad7Bottom"><span>Large firms, organisations and schools. </span> We bring the professional studio to your
        place and establish passport photographs, pictures for your personnel database or class- and student
        photographs.
